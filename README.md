# DevMakingSource
Source code repository for various Algorithms and Data Structure implementations in multiple languages that will be featured on the website <a href="www.devmaking.com">DevMaking</a>.

As the site grows and more articles are created, this repo will be updated as well with new implementations and code changes.

## Current languages implemented (July 6, 2019):
- Java
- C#
- PHP
- Python (3.x)

## Languages queued for implementation:
- C/C++
- TypeScript
- JavaScript

### Maybe someday languages:
- Scala
- Lisp
- Objective-C
- Swift
- Ruby
> No current guarantee of these languages being implemented, however languages with overwhelming requests will likely be pushed to the queue.
